Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based program that assists users in keeping their income and expenses streamlined and organized. The program provides the functionality to enter transactions, classify them as type (Expense or Income), and view their financial data in the form of interactive charts. The aim of this project is to give users a simple-to-use interface through which they can monitor their expenditure habits, understand their income allocation, and make sound financial decisions.

It is constructed with Flask as the backend, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Matplotlib for creating data visualizations. The user interface is handled using HTML, CSS, and Jinja templates to provide a responsive and clean design. Users enter transactions with a title, description, and amount, and all information is stored in a SQLite database. The home page shows all transactions in a table, with filtering to change between all transactions, income alone, or expenses alone. Two interactive graphs are provided: a pie graph displaying the ratio of income to spending, and a bar graph splitting spending into categories.

One of the key features of this app is removing transactions using a clean and simple ❌ icon instead of a normal button. This is an improvement on the user experience because it makes the interface look more beautiful and clean. The app also incorporates error handling so that it will not crash when there are no transactions, so empty states are handled well.

The application's central logic is located in the project.py file. This contains the Flask routes to create, delete, and view transactions, as well as the SQLAlchemy model used to define the Transaction table within the database. It also contains the logic for creating visualizations with Matplotlib, including methods to calculate the total income and expenses and produce dynamic plots based on user input.

The index.html template is the primary user interface where all transactions are listed in a table. It offers filters to show only income, only expenses, or all transactions. There is a delete button for every transaction entry in the form of a red ❌ icon, through which users can delete unwanted transactions. The page loads the pie chart and bar chart dynamically using base64-encoded images created in the backend.

add_transaction.html is utilized to post the new transactions. It has a form through which users can input transaction type, title, description, and amount and then submit the form. When the form is submitted, the transaction is posted on the database as well as on the homepage in real time.

The styles.css holds all the customized styling for the app. It adds to the overall design by attaining spacing, the application of color themes, and button and filter looks. Even the delete button and filters have been designed with improved user interface. The navigation bar has been provided with a clean and minimalist touch, with the logo making the app more professional.

One of the project's design choices was the application of filters for transaction control. At first, the application merely showed all the transactions combined together so it was hard to tell the difference between income and expenditure. The use of filters has allowed easy switching between types of transactions quickly, enhancing user experience. Another essential design choice was using a graphical form of finance data in Matplotlib charts. This allows users to view their expenditures at a glance, without having to go through transaction records manually.

Several problems arose in the development stage. Among them was an important problem regarding how to handle situations where no transactions existed within the database, and this would lead Matplotlib to spit exceptions at first whenever it created charts. It was fixed by the inclusion of error handling that prevents the creation of charts when no transactions exist but rather prints out a dummy message. The other problem that arose was how transaction deletion could properly update the UI without reloading the page. This was resolved by dealing with database commits and redirections correctly when a transaction was deleted.

The finance tracker can be expanded in many ways. Future additions could include adding user authentication so that multiple individuals can track their finances independently. Another feature would be to enable users to edit transactions instead of just removing them. Users could also set financial targets and track their progress over time, making a fuller financial planning application. A dark mode toggle could be added to give some pizzazz to the UI and make it more usable in low-light environments.

Briefly, the Personal Finance Tracker is a simple but powerful personal finance management software. It uses Flask for backend development, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Matplotlib for plotting. The software has features for tracking expenses and income, filtering transactions, and presenting dynamic charts for analysis. The interface is minimalist and user-friendly to enable easy and efficient financial tracking.

Through this project, I have gained experience in working with Flask, database integration using SQLAlchemy, and creating dynamic web applications with Jinja templates. I also learned how to handle errors effectively, optimize database queries, and implement interactive visualizations with Matplotlib. Overall, this project has helped me build a deeper understanding of web development and data management, and I look forward to expanding its functionality in the future.
